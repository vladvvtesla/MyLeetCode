"""

A typical application: first sort by name, then sort by section

Q. Which sort are stable?
A. Insertion sort and mergesort (but not selection sort or shellsort)

Note Need to carefully check code ("less than" vs "less than or equal to " )

Quicksort is an efficient, but unstable, sorting algorithm

Mergesort is an efficient and stable sorting algorithm
